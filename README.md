Portfolio using Bootstrap

This application contains a page that tells a little bit about me.  You will see two other clickable links at the top right of the page, one containing links to the work that I have accomplished in this class, and another that contains a contact form that you can fill out and submit.  This project was very similar to the first one, except we had to incorporate Bootstrap this time, which ended up being a lot more difficult than expected.
