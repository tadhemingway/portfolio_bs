                <p>This page is intended to introduce myself and give my audience the opportunity to
                    see what I have accomplished while working towards becoming a web developer.
                </p>
                <p>While going to college for my bachelors, like many others, I didn't really know
                    what I wanted to do. As time passed, I knew that I had to focus on something, so
                    I chose the field of finance and accounting. I graduated with a Bachelors in Finance
                    in 2010, then decided to go back and get a Masters in Accounting. Since I have graduated
                    with my masters degree, I have obtained CMA designation and accumulated 6 years of
                    experience,
                    mostly as a financial analyst. Not until a few years into my career as a financial analyst
                    did I realize that
                    I did not have enough passion for it. However, what I did realize is that I loved everything
                    about Excel, building financial models, creating complex formulas, and creating macros for
                    reducing the time it takes for repetitive tasks. It took a little bit of time to put myself
                    in the right position, but I am now attending a coding bootcamp at UT Austin and know that
                    I have made the right choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for taking the time to look at my material, and I hope you appreciate what you
                    see.
